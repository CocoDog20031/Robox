##Building, Wiring and Programming.


##Credits

Contained in this file is the fruits of collaboration between awesome coders and educators who envision use of this platform in their classes.

Credits to Nicky Ringland of Sydney Universisty for naming the robot, coding the Direction-Decision-Making code (Based on measurements from the Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor), and for creating the slideshow which covers construction (link here).
(Thanks also for providing the name for the project). 

Credits to Chris Newton for his enthusiasm, support, and offering use of his classroom's computers for the afterschool activity.  
We worked out a way to control the robot movement more intuitively 
(
Forward(100);//drive the motors 100%-power forward 
delay(1000);//wait 1 second
//etc.
)

Credits to students who came to Viz Valley Middle School's Afterschool-Robotics-Activity for their innovations and improvements to the Robo

Last but not least, credits to William and Jane Fujimoto for their work and enthusiasm through the prototyping stages.

##Cardboard Chassis

With a cardboard chassis, students truly build the robot completely using off the shelf components (a funduino, jumper wires, continuous-rotation servos, a 9V battery, and a 9V holder).
